-- INSTALLING -- 
Here are some quick install instructions for Linux (& CygWin)

To install command line version:
  Install an OCaml Compiler then do:
	make && ./main

Running main directly may be rather unuser-friendly.
You make instead want to run it via a command editor, e.g.
	rlwrap ./main  

To install the Web Version:
  install apache or similar and do
    	make www
 
  You should then be able to access:  
	http://<yourserver>/mechecker.html

-- IMPORTANT FILES --
        main.ml: the top level source file, mostly a wrapper around ...
	me.ml: the file that has the actual model-checker
	benchmarkset.sh: Run this to regenerate the benchmarks
	make_graphs.sh: Run this to remake graphs
