  NL-BATL* tableau (Prototype)
</title>

<body>
  This is implementation in progress of a NL-BATL*/BATL* tableau. 
  It presently decides the NL-BATL* semantics but that is trivial to change.</p>

  Currently the only way to input a formula is to manually play with the URL.</p>

  The tableau determines the number of agents based on the largest
  agent# found in the formula. For example,
	<a href="?f^-{2}f">f^-{2}f</a>
  is satisfiable but 
	<a href="?f^-{1}f">f^-{1}f</a> is not.</p>

  NOTE: this is a mostly complete protoype. Do not trust the output yet.
  Also this javascript version is even slower and less featureful than the native
  version</p>
