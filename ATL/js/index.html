  NL-BATL* tableau (Prototype)
</title>

<body>
  This is implementation in progress of a NL-BATL*/BATL* tableau.</p>

  Currently the only way to input a formula is to manually play with the URL.</p>

  Formulas have syntax defined by the following BNF notation where p is any lowercase letter and n..m is any sequence of digits: <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &phi; := p <cal>|</cal> (&phi; ^ &phi;) <cal>|</cal> -&phi; <cal>|</cal> (&phi; U &phi;) <cal>|</cal> X&phi; <cal>|</cal> F&phi; <cal>|</cal> G&phi; <cal>|</cal> A&phi; <cal>|</cal> E&phi; <cal>|</cal> (&phi; | &phi;) <cal>|</cal> (&phi; &gt; &phi;) <cal>|</cal> {n..m} &phi; <cal>|</cal> [n..m] &phi; <br/>
 
  <p>These operators are to be read as: atomic (p)ropostion, and (^), negation (-), (U)ntil, ne(X)t, (F)inally, (G)lobally/always, on (A)ll paths/futures, there (E)xists a path, or (|), implies (&gt;), strategy ({n..m}), and co-strategy ([n..m]).  If p is an uppercase letter: P, Q, R, then p is interpreted as a (non-local) path atom rather than a state atom.</p>

  The tableau determines the number of agents based on the largest
  agent# found in the formula. For example,
  <a href="?(P^-{1}P)^{2}Q">(P^-{1}P)^{2}Q</a> and 
	<a href="?P^-{2}P">P^-{2}P</a>
  are satisfiable but 
	<a href="?P^-{1}P">P^-{1}P</a> is not.
	Some more examples 
		<a href="?({1}P>{12}P)"i>1</a>, 
		<a href="?~({1}P>{12}P)"i>1</a>, 
	... 
	</p>


  NOTE: this is a protoype. Do not trust the output yet.
  Also this javascript version is even slower and less featureful than the native
  version. Firefox seems to hang when JavaScript is busy. Google-Chrome may be more pleasant. You should be able to download this file for offline use.</p>
